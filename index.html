        <h1>Sam Spott</h1>
        <h2>Hi, it's nice to meet you.</h2>
        <p>I am a high-spirited, dog-loving, outdoor enthusiast based out of Hood River, Oregon. As a UX Designer I believe that with every click, tap, or view within our digital world, it should bring you nothing but ease and contentment. This is why I focus on creating simple and enjoyable experiences designed specifically for our end users. </p>
        <p>My Baground started off in Denver, Colorado where I grew up admiring the creative world. Name any style of art or craft; and I figured out how to master it. That is how I learned that I can teach myself anything. After 5 years of exploring different fields of work, I found myself craving that creative lifestyle once again. Fast forward to now, and Iâ€™m overjoyed to be a part of the UI/UX world.  </p>
        <p>My skills include user research, empathy, qualitative interviewing, wireframing, prototyping, user testing, and collaborating.</p>
